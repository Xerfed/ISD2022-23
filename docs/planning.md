# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
- Information about museums is already readly available for the public. 
- The Bristol Opendata of museum visits has not been updated sinces 2019.
- There is a lot of competitors in this spaces for example the museums also have their own apps sometimes rewarding people for downloading it by giving things such as free coffee or free entry tickets.

### Business benefits
- Makes all Bristol museums data readily accessible in one website/application and the users won't need to go to other apps or search. 
- Website/App mostly targets tourists and people visiting Bristol. Tourist makes a large contribution towards popularity of places and help local businesses. 

### Options Considered
- It puts all of the infomation in one place, making it easy to use and access for the public.
-  
### Expected Risks
- Having too large of a scope or getting too complex, which will work against the goal of ease and availability.
