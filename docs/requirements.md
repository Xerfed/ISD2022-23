# Requirements

## User Needs
- Users should be able to see the total number of people visiting
- Users should be able to interact with the web application
- Not only see museums but also recommend things such as other local restaurants through google maps
- We want to showcase information in a simple way, for readability
- Maybe a translated website?
- Asks for User location to pin point to nearest museum 
### User stories
Our goal is to make it easy for users to see when the museums is busiest and when it is not. We might also apply some ways for more users to use the app such as giving free coupons for museum visit or getting a free coffee for a local restaurant. Our plan is to boost the local businesses and help them. 
### Actors
Our target demographic mostly consists of tourists, elderly and teenagers.
