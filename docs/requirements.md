# Requirements

## User Needs
Thw Users should be able to see the total number of people visiting and should be able to interact with the web application.
They will not only see museums but also recommend things such as other local restaurants through google maps as this goes with our business goal which is to help local community. The information in which we are planning to showcase should be done in a simple way, for readability and plan to maybe add a translated website for tourist?
The webapplication will need to ask for users current location to pin point to the nearest museum.

### User stories
Our goal is to make it easy for users to see when the museums is busiest and when it is not. We might also apply some ways for more users to use the app such as giving free coupons for museum visit or getting a free coffee for a local restaurant. Our plan is to boost the local businesses and help them. 

### Actors
Our target demographic mostly consists of tourists, elderly and teenagers. 

### Use Cases
TODO: Describe each use case (one per team member).
    Give each use case a unique ID, e.g. UC1, UC2, ...
    Summarise these using the use-case template below.

| Use Case 1 (John) | Museum Data |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description** | Tourist would like to know if the bristol museums are busy or not. |
| **Actors** | Tourist/User of App |
| **Assumptions** | Browser is able to show current data of museum. </td></tr>
| **Steps** | 
    1. User opens web browser
    2. Get data from Bristol Open Database  
    3. Shows the current number of people in the local museum and others. 
    4. Shows wether it is busy or not.   
    5. Be able to see wether a museum is busy or not print a text "Not Busy", "Moderately Busy", "Busy". 
| **Variations** | The browser may not support the code writen as some phones screen resolution may clutter the readablity of the text. |
| **Non-functional** | Could change how the web app is going to look. The sevice should be able to run on Google Chrome as this is the default browser of most phones and desktop. |
| **Issues** | An issue could a rise as the app will print the number of museum vistors accross all Bristol museum not just one. So if one museum is busy and another is not the web app will not be able to distinguish which is busy or not. | </td></tr>
