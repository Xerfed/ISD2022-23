## User Interface design 
(John)\
This is a rough idea of what the overall webpage will look like. [Some of the design may be altered at the final stage of implementation.]


Our initial design includes:
- A Home Page
- Popular Museums
- Museum List
- Map

**Elliott's Use Case Wireframe:**

This is the prospective design layout and flow of the website from the perspective of assertaining museum popularity data:

An initial page would demonstrate information about the purpose of the web-app, located on the left would be hyperlinks that take you to a map, oriented on your location, that shows (labeled) museums in Bristol near you; click on these would give you a description of said museum.

"Busy Locations" would take you to a page that shows you (as current as possible) data about the popularity of a given museum (decided by dropdown selection). Intended to be informed by hour-to-hour averages instead of realtime.

"Popularity Data" would give you similar information and data choice that is instead informed by historical data on a larger scale, instead of hour to hour, derived from the MySQL database from Bristol Open Data.
