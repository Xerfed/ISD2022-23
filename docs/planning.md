# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Information about museums is already readly available for the public. Opening times and closing times for the museum is readily available on the museums website. Google Maps has information regarding the times when the museum is busy. On the other hand the data given by Bristol Opendata of "museum visits" has not been updated since 2019. There is a lot of competitors within this space. For example: Museums also have their own app which sometimes reward people for downloading it or by giving complimentary items such as a free coffee or free entry tickets top their users.

### Business benefits
Our plan is to make all Bristol museums data readily accessible in one website/application so that the users won't need to go to other apps or search for data about certain museums. By providing easily accessible information this will help improve the usability for people that are not comfortable with downloading apps or using technology. We plan to create a Website that mostly targets tourists and people visiting Bristol. Tourism makes a large contribution towards popularity of places and has a lot of potential to help local businesses. 

### Options Considered
It puts all of the infomation in one place, making it easy to use and access for the public. We plan to add easy navigation on our website and different onclick interactive elements for the users to engage with. We are exploring a way to add a local map so that the user knows their current location and showcase different local cafes or food businesses. 

## Expected Risks
Having too large of a scope or getting too complex, which will work against the goal of ease and availability.
Overloading the website with many elements could lead to eye clutter which is someting we should avoid. Important to consider the demographic using the tool and therefore the technological skill of said groups.
