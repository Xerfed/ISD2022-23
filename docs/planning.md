# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Information about museums is already readly available for the public. Opening times and closing times for the museum is readily available on the museums website. Google Maps has information regarding the times when the museum is busy. On the other hand the data given by Bristol Opendata of "museum visits" has not been updated since 2019. There is a lot of competitors within this space. For example: Museums also have their own app which sometimes reward people for downloading it or by giving complimentary items such as a free coffee or free entry tickets top their users.

### Business benefits
- Makes all Bristol museums data readily accessible in one website/application and the users won't need to go to other apps or search. 
- Website/App mostly targets tourists and people visiting Bristol. Tourist makes a large contribution towards popularity of places and help local businesses. 

### Options Considered
- It puts all of the infomation in one place, making it easy to use and access for the public.
-  
### Expected Risks
- Having too large of a scope or getting too complex, which will work against the goal of ease and availability.
